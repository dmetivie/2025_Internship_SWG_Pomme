INRAE-MISTEA Internships by Arnaud Gonin

@dmetivie - David MÃ©tivier INRAE MISTEA

## The problem



## What has been done


## What will be done

### Data manipulations

### Bibliography

### Report

You both have a report to write a report and prepare an oral presentation (@Robin tu confirmes?).
Keep that in mind and try to takes notes during the whole internship and not at the last minute.

## Tooling

You can have a look on [the presentation](https://github.com/dmetivie/MyJuliaIntroDocs.jl/tree/master/first_day) I used on the first day.

- Programming language
  - Julia
- "IDE"
  - For dev, scripts, package (?) -> VSCode (except if you have other preference).
  - Notebooks to summarize and present advancement/results
- Cluster: Hopefully we will have some slot to run GPU simulations on the cluster.
- For data manipulations my go to is DataFrames.jl combined with DataFramesMeta.jl. [Here](https://david.metivier.pages.mia.inra.fr/website/julia_weather/) is a simple example I made
- Zotero for Bibliography. I heard of shared bibliography using Zotero, this might be an idea.

I like the [PhD ressource website](https://phd-resources.github.io/) by Guillaume Dalle (heavy Julia user). He gives a lot of cool tips, software etc for students (not only PhD).
